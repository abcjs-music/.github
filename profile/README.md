# abcjs-music

Tools that use the abcjs javascript library.

## abcjs

The core library is on [Github](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs). It is a way to put sheet music in any system that supports SVG. Because the music 
is in SVG and not PDF, animations and other transformations can happen. And, since the musical information is stored in a small text string, it can be 
stored and passed around easily.

## ABC format

The [ABC music format](https://abcnotation.com/) was originally created by [Chris Walshaw](https://chriswalshaw.co.uk/) and is widely used for 
traditional music and is also useful for many other types of music. Its great advantage is that it is very compact and is purely a text string 
and so it is easy to store and move around. It is ideal for JavaScript.

Many of the questions that come in about abcjs are actually about how to use the format. There is a great 
[list of tutorials](https://abcnotation.com/learn) maintained by Chris Walshaw.
